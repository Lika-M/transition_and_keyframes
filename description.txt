-------------------ANIMATING MOMENTS (UX)------------------------
When to animate:

1. Orientation -->
    Where am I? 
    Traveling somewhere.. New view, new page.
    The example with rotating login form, where appears a new page on the other side.
    We understand your step, and you can go ahead.

2. Functional changes
    What does this element do now? Radio buttons or another toggle element. Help to know the state in here.
    Hamburger menu, when on click it changes the state.

3. New element
    What should I look at? 
    Something new is on the page, and we help him to view where it is.
    Temporary element like a Modal or a new interface element, alert message, some success like congratulations. 
    Dropdown menu. Adding friends in a list of opportunity. 
    Animation helps people what changed and why.

4. Highlight
    What is important on this page? 
    Little pulsing or highlighting brings attention to a spot. Draw attention line in a very crowded page.

5. Visual feedback
    Is the layout understandable what I'm trying to do?
    Navigate, send the message /it jumps up/. The user has a feeling that the message is flying.
    Represents the idea of motion.

6. System status 
    Is this working? How long does it take? Processing flows.
    We need to let the user know he was not blocked, it works. Progress bar with different speeds.
    Spinner. They tell us a story.

Animation connects with the emotional level!
User actions that show us they are requesting something from the interface. 
Moments of change. Motion of state from one state to another.
